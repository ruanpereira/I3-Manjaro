## Manjaro i3 Settings.

Manjaro is a operational system based in Arch Linux, you can find a link to download the .ISO in [this link](https://manjaro.org/downloads/community/i3/)
In this repositore i will show how i configurated the system, and my personal opnion about how the Manjaro i3 can be a better system.I did this repo because i wanted to crave my learning about this system and the tiling window mananger (i3). Also to safe configurations, do some tests and etc.


Guess help :P

## Troubleshooting: 

- Audio: just put $ install_pulse on a terminal.
- Poor Navegator: Change to firefox in mime.apps and .profile and you should be good. 
- Keybinds: super + shift + h for quick use or https://i3wm.org/docs/userguide.html for detailed use.
- Monitors: ?
- Installing apps: $ sudo pacman -Ss 'app' and $ sudo pacman -S 'app' solve 99% of the problems. 
- Periferics: Plug and play to this day of edition.
