<h1> Wallpaper change </h1>

<p> Simply go to the execution command <code>$mod + D</code> and search for:

<ul style="list-style-type:circle">
  <li>Nitrogen
</u>

You will find a interface with various native wallpapers. To add some wallpaper, go to the preference button in
the right corner and see the path to the directory with te wallpapers, then, go to that path and add the file that you want and close 'n open.<br>

Usualy, the path is <code> /usr/share/backgrounds</code>

So, if you want to put a wallpaper here, you can use this command, if you are in the directory that has the wallpaper: <br>

<code> sudo mv <name-of-the-file.jpg> /usr/share/backgrounds </code>
</p>
